        /*
        1)What is Javascript?
            -JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.
            -JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages
            -JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.
        2)What are Javascript data types?
        There are 7 primitive data types:
            - Boolean type.
            - Null type.
            - Undefined type. 
            -Number type. 
            -BigInt type.
            - String type.
            - Symbol type.
            -Objects (collections of properties).
        3)What is variable?
            -In JavaScript, a variable stores the data value.or
            -A JavaScript variable is simply a name of storage location
            - The default value of variables that do not have any value is undefined.
            - two types of variables in JavaScript :
                - local variable and 
                -global variable.
        4)What is Const in javascript?
            -Constants are block-scoped, much like variables declared using the let keyword.
            - The value of a constant can't be changed through reassignment, and it can't be redeclared.
        5)What is an identifier?
            -An identifier is a sequence of characters in the code that identifies a variable, function, or property.
            -In JavaScript, identifiers are case-sensitive and can contain Unicode letters, $ , _ , and digits (0-9), but may not start with a digit.
        6)Different javascript data types?
            -There are 7 primitive data types: string, number, bigint, boolean, null, undefined, and symbol.
            - which common operations can be performed.
        7)what is operators?
            -An operator is capable of manipulating a certain value or operand.
            - Operators are used to perform specific mathematical and logical computations on operands.
            - In JavaScript operators are used for compare values, perform arithmetic operations etc.
            -There are various operators supported by JavaScript:
                -Arithmetic 
                -Comparison Operators
                -Logical Operators
                -Assignment Operators
                -Ternary Operators
                -typeof Operator 
        8)types of null?
            -null.
        
        9)What is primitive data type and non-primitive data type in JavaScript?
            -Primitive data types are number, string, boolean, NULL, Infinity and symbol.
            -Non-primitive data types is the object.
